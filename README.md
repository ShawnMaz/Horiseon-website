# Horiseon Website Refactoring Project

## Description
The purpose of this project is to refactor the code base of an existing site to simulate an On-the-job ticket. This project will also provide an opportunity to apply the HTML and CSS concpets that were introduced thus far.

## Client Requirements
The client is a marketing agency who wants a codebase that follows the accessiblity standards so that the site is optimized for search engines.

## Acceptance Criteria for the Website
The website must meet the following accessiblity standards:
* Semantic HTML elements must be used.
* HTML follows a logical structure independent of styling and positioning.
* Descriptive image alt attribute must be used where applicable.
* Heading attributes follows a sequential order.
* The title element of the page will have a descriptive and a concise title.

## Mock up
The following image shows the websites appearance and functionality:

>Note: The layout of the website is designed for "desktop" only. Responsive design has not been covered at this point of the course.

## Challenges Faced
During the refactoring task, I initially started by fixing the HTML structure and content of a section and then fixing the style for that structure. But ran into problems with styling since some of the CSS codes repeats in other sections. So I fixed all the HTML structure and content first and then fixed the style sheet.

## Deployed Site
The refactored site can be accessed by clicking [here](https://shawnmaz.github.io/Horiseon-website/).
